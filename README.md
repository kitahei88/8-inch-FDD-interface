#8inch FDD adapter and Power board
---

This interface and power board is made for 8inch ANSI like interface drives and Pauline or any other FDD dump devices.
You can dump (or maybe write) 8 inch disk with this boards.
(And may be use with PC/AT machines that have FDD interfaces)

I tested NEC FD1165A and Pauline.
